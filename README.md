# hangman-client-jquery

### Introduction

The software is a non-framework implementation of component-based single-page
front-end application of the [Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game))
game.  Individual user interface elements were designed to be pure and to mutate
their visual state only in response to the incoming data.

Game states are managed by a CORS implementation of the [hangman-server](https://github.com/aptivator/hangman-server).
The service itself may be directly accessed through the following [Heroku instance](https://guarded-cliffs-93737.herokuapp.com).
